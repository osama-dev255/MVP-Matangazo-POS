## Supabase Integration

This project now includes Supabase integration for real-time data persistence and authentication. To set up Supabase:

1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy your project's URL and anon key from the project settings
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   ```
5. Refer to `.env.example` for a template
6. Follow the database setup instructions in [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md)

For a complete schema with all tables and relationships, use the [SUPABASE_COMPLETE_SCHEMA.sql](SUPABASE_COMPLETE_SCHEMA.sql) file.

The Supabase client is configured in `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` and can be imported anywhere in your application.

### Authentication

The POS system now supports Supabase authentication:
- User sign up, sign in, and sign out
- Session management
- Protected routes
- Password reset functionality

Authentication is handled through:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context provider
- `src/services/authService.ts` - Authentication service functions
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Component to protect routes
- `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` - Updated login form with Supabase integration

## Deployment

   ```
2. Login to your Netlify account:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```
3. Deploy your site:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Build your project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to your Netlify dashboard

#### Option 3: Using Deployment Scripts
- On Windows: Run `deploy.bat`
- On macOS/Linux: Run `deploy.sh`

### Environment Variables for Production
When deploying to Netlify, make sure to set the following environment variables in your Netlify project settings:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key
