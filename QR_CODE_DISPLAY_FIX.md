# QR Code Display Fix

## Issue Summary

You were experiencing an issue where QR codes were being generated successfully (as evidenced by the "QR Code loaded successfully" message) but were not visually displaying in the receipts.

## Root Cause

The issue was related to **window handling timing** in the receipt generation process. The receipt window was being closed too quickly before the QR code image could be fully rendered and displayed.

## Solution Implemented

I've updated the window handling in both the sales and purchase receipt functions in [printUtils.ts](file:///E:/PROJECTS/LOVABLE/bulletproofPOS/sheet-point-dash-Supabasedev255%20-%20Copy/src/utils/printUtils.ts) to ensure proper QR code display:

### Before (Problematic Code):
```javascript
receiptWindow.document.open();
receiptWindow.document.write(receiptContent);
receiptWindow.document.close();
receiptWindow.focus();
receiptWindow.print();
receiptWindow.close(); // This was closing the window too quickly
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
// Improved window handling to ensure proper QR code display
receiptWindow.document.open();
receiptWindow.document.write(receiptContent);
receiptWindow.document.close();

// Wait for content to load before printing
receiptWindow.addEventListener('load', () => {
  receiptWindow.focus();
  // Small delay to ensure QR code image is fully rendered
  setTimeout(() => {
    receiptWindow.print();
    // Don't close immediately to allow user to see the receipt
    // receiptWindow.close();
  }, 500);
});
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Event-Driven Approach**: Wait for the receipt window to fully load before attempting to print
2. **Timing Delay**: Added a 500ms delay to ensure the QR code image is fully rendered
3. **Window Persistence**: Commented out the immediate window close to allow users to see the receipt

## Verification

The fix has been implemented in both:
- ✅ Sales receipt function (`printReceipt`)
- ✅ Purchase receipt function (`printPurchaseReceipt`)

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Generate a sales receipt and check if the QR code displays
2. Generate a purchase receipt and check if the QR code displays
3. Check the browser console for "QR Code loaded successfully" messages
4. Ensure the receipt window stays open long enough to see the QR code

## Additional Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can now see the receipt before it prints
2. **More Reliable Printing**: Printing happens after all content is fully loaded
3. **Improved Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot display issues with the window staying open

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience issues with QR code display:

1. Check browser console for any error messages
2. Try disabling browser extensions (especially ad blockers)
3. Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
4. Clear browser cache and try again
