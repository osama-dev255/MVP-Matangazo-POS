# Fixes and Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to resolve the "Failed to add products" issue and related problems.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Category ID Handling Issue
**Problem**: The application was sending category names (e.g., "Food & Beverage") instead of valid UUIDs for the `category_id` field.
**Error**: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "Food & Beverage"`
**Fix**: Modified ProductManagement component to load actual categories from the database and use proper category IDs.

### 2. RLS (Row Level Security) Policies
**Problem**: RLS was enabled on tables but no policies were defined to allow operations.
**Fix**: Created SQL scripts to add proper RLS policies for all tables.

### 3. Environment Configuration
**Problem**: Extra blank lines in the .env file were causing issues.
**Fix**: Cleaned up the .env file.

### 4. Connection Testing Issues
**Problem**: The `rpc/now` function doesn't exist, causing connection test failures.
**Fix**: Replaced with a simple product query.
