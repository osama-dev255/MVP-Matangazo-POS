## Summary
The QR code display issue has been resolved by improving the timing of window handling in the receipt generation process. The fix ensures that QR codes are properly displayed in both sales and purchase receipts by:
1. Waiting for the receipt window to fully load before printing
2. Adding a delay to ensure QR code images are fully rendered
3. Keeping the window open so users can see the receipt before it prints
