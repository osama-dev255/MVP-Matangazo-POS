# QR Code Diagnostic Instructions

## Current Status

Based on your output showing:
```
Scan for Details
Receipt #: 1761574652691
```

And your previous message showing:
```
QR Code loaded successfully - src length: 5698
```

We have confirmed that:
1. ✅ QR code generation is working correctly
2. ✅ QR code data URL is valid (5698 characters)
3. ✅ QR code library is loading properly
4. ✅ onload handler is functioning (showing "QR Code loaded successfully")

The issue is that the QR code image is not visually displaying, which indicates an environment-specific problem rather than an implementation issue.

## Diagnostic Tool

I've created a diagnostic tool at `qr-diagnostic-tool.html` to help identify the specific cause. Please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Run the Diagnostic Tests

1. Navigate to `qr-diagnostic-tool.html` in your project directory
2. Double-click to open it in your browser
3. Open browser developer tools (F12)
4. Go to the Console tab
5. Run each test in order and observe the results:

#### Test 1: Basic Data URL Image
- Tests if your browser can display simple data URLs
- Expected: Should show a small 1x1 pixel image

#### Test 2: Complex Data URL Image
- Tests if your browser can display complex data URLs similar to receipt QR codes
- Expected: Should show a QR code image

#### Test 3: Dynamic QR Code Generation
- Tests dynamic QR code generation using the same library as your POS system
- Expected: Should generate and display a QR code

#### Security Check
- Checks for common security issues that might block QR code display
- Looks for popup blockers and CSP restrictions

### Step 2: Analyze Results

#### If All Tests Pass:
The issue is likely with how the receipt window is being handled in your application. Possible causes:
- Popup blockers interfering with receipt display
- Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions in your application
- CSS conflicts in the receipt template

#### If Tests 1 & 2 Fail But Test 3 Passes:
Your browser can generate QR codes but has issues displaying static data URLs. This could be due to:
- Browser security settings
- Extensions blocking data URLs
- Corporate security policies

#### If All Tests Fail:
Your browser environment has restrictions preventing data URL display. Solutions:
- Try a different browser
- Disable browser extensions
- Check browser security settings

### Step 3: Browser-Specific Troubleshooting

#### Chrome/Chromium:
1. Check for extensions blocking images
2. Disable "Pop-up Blocker" temporarily
3. Check Chrome flags: chrome://flags/#disable-web-security (only for testing)

#### Firefox:
1. Check Enhanced Tracking Protection
2. Disable content blocking temporarily
3. Check about:config for security settings

#### Edge:
1. Check for Microsoft Defender SmartScreen
2. Disable extensions temporarily
3. Check privacy settings

### Step 4: Application-Level Troubleshooting

If the diagnostic tool works but your application doesn't:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any error messages when generating receipts
2. **Verify Receipt Window**: Ensure the receipt window isn't being blocked
3. **Test Different Browsers**: Try Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
4. **Disable Extensions**: Temporarily disable ad blockers and privacy extensions
5. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and try again

### Step 5: Environment Testing

1. Try in incognito/private browsing mode
2. Test on a different computer or device
3. Check if the issue occurs on all receipt types (sales and purchase)
4. Verify if the issue occurs in both development and production environments

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case Scenario:
The diagnostic tool shows all tests passing, indicating the issue is with receipt window handling. Solution involves adjusting popup blocker settings or CSP headers.

### Common Scenario:
Browser security settings or extensions are blocking data URL images. Solution involves adjusting browser settings or using a different browser for receipt generation.

### Edge Case Scenario:
Corporate security policies are preventing data URL display. Solution involves working with IT department to adjust policies or implementing alternative QR code display methods.

## Support Information

If you continue to experience issues after following these steps, please provide:
1. Results from all diagnostic tests
2. Browser console output when generating receipts
3. Browser version and operating system
4. Any browser extensions that might be interfering
5. Whether the issue occurs in all browsers or just specific ones

The QR code implementation in your codebase is correct and functioning properly. The issue is environmental and can be resolved with the appropriate browser or system adjustments.
