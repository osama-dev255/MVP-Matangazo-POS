# QR Code Build Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Netlify build was failing with the error:
```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "qrcode" from "/opt/build/repo/src/utils/printUtils.ts".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that Vite was having trouble bundling the `qrcode` library during the production build process. This is a common issue with libraries that have Node.js dependencies but are used in browser environments.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Import of QRCode Library
Changed the import strategy in `src/utils/printUtils.ts`:
- **Before**: Static import `import QRCode from "qrcode";`
- **After**: Dynamic import only when needed

```typescript
// Dynamically import QRCode only when needed to avoid build issues
let QRCode: any;

async function getQRCode() {
  if (!QRCode) {
    QRCode = (await import('qrcode')).default;
  }
  return QRCode;
}
```

### 2. Updated QR Code Generation Functions
Modified all QR code generation functions to use the dynamic import:

```typescript
// In generateReceiptQRCode function:
const QRCode = await getQRCode();

// In printReceipt function:
const QRCode = await getQRCode();

// In printPurchaseReceipt function:
const QRCode = await getQRCode();
```

### 3. Removed External Configuration
Removed the `external: ['qrcode']` configuration from `vite.config.ts` since we're now properly bundling the library.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Build Compatibility**: The application now builds successfully in production environments
2. **Lazy Loading**: QRCode library is only loaded when actually needed, reducing initial bundle size
3. **Runtime Performance**: No impact on application startup time
4. **Compatibility**: Works in both development and production environments

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/printUtils.ts` - Updated QRCode import and usage
2. `vite.config.ts` - Removed external configuration

## Build Status
✅ **SUCCESS**: Local build completes successfully
✅ **SUCCESS**: All assets generated in dist folder
✅ **SUCCESS**: Changes pushed to GitHub
✅ **EXPECTED**: Netlify build should now succeed

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Generate a sales receipt and check if QR code displays
2. Generate a purchase receipt and check if QR code displays
3. Verify "QR Code loaded successfully" messages appear in console
4. Confirm Netlify deployment succeeds

This fix resolves both the build issue and maintains all QR code functionality.
