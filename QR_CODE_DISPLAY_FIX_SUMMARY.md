# QR Code Display Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis

Based on your output showing "QR Code loaded successfully - src length: 5698", we've confirmed that:

1. **QR Code Generation is Working**: The QR code is being generated correctly with a valid data URL
2. **Library Loading is Successful**: The QRCode library is properly imported and functioning
3. **Data URL is Valid**: The generated data URL is of appropriate length (5698 characters) indicating a valid QR code

However, the QR code is not visually displaying on the receipt, which indicates a display/rendering issue rather than a generation issue.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced QR Code HTML Attributes
Modified [printUtils.ts](file:///E:/PROJECTS/LOVABLE/bulletproofPOS/sheet-point-dash-Supabasedev255%20-%20Copy/src/utils/printUtils.ts) to include explicit width and height attributes:

```html
<img src="${qrCodeDataUrl}" width="120" height="120" class="qr-code-img" ... />
```

### 2. Improved CSS Styling
Added additional CSS properties to ensure proper display:

```css
.qr-code-img {
    max-width: 120px;
    height: auto;
    width: 120px;
    height: 120px;
    margin: 10px auto;
    display: block;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    background: #f9f9f9;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging Information
Added more detailed console logging to track rendering:

```javascript
onload="console.log('QR Code loaded successfully - src length:', this.src?.length || 0);
        console.log('QR Code dimensions - naturalWidth:', this.naturalWidth, 'naturalHeight:', this.naturalHeight);"
```

## Debugging Recommendations

### Browser Console Debugging
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for any errors when generating receipts
3. Look for Content Security Policy (CSP) violations
4. Check for any JavaScript errors that might prevent rendering

### Network Tab Analysis
1. Open Network tab in developer tools
2. Generate a receipt
3. Look for the data URL request (it should appear as a very long data:image/png;base64,... URL)
4. Check if the request is being blocked or if there are any errors

### Elements Tab Inspection
1. Open Elements tab in developer tools
2. Generate a receipt and inspect the QR code img element
3. Check if the src attribute is properly set
4. Verify computed styles - check if display is set to none or if there are any visibility issues
5. Check if the image has zero dimensions

### Environment Testing
1. Try generating receipts in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Disable browser extensions, especially ad blockers or privacy tools
3. Try in incognito/private browsing mode
4. Clear browser cache and try again

## Conclusion

The QR code generation is working correctly, but there may be environment-specific issues preventing proper display. The enhanced implementation with explicit dimensions and improved styling should resolve most display issues. If problems persist, follow the debugging recommendations to identify the specific cause in your environment.
